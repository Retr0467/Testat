    <h1>WhatsApp Rolls Out Lockdown-Style Security Mode to Protect Targeted Users From Spyware</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Meta on Tuesday announced it's adding Strict Account Settings on WhatsApp to secure certain users against
        advanced cyber
        attacks because of who they are and what they do.

        The feature, similar to Lockdown Mode in Apple iOS and Advanced Protection in Android, aims to protect
        individuals, such
        as journalists or public-facing figures, from sophisticated spyware by trading some functionality for enhanced
        security.

        Once this security mode is enabled, some of the account settings will be locked to the most restrictive options,
        while
        simultaneously blocking attachments and media from people not in a user's contacts.

        "This lockdown-style feature bolsters your security on WhatsApp even further with just a few taps by locking
        your
        account to the most restrictive settings like automatically blocking attachments and media from unknown senders,
        silencing calls from people you don't know, and restricting other settings that may limit how the app works,"
        Meta said.</p>
